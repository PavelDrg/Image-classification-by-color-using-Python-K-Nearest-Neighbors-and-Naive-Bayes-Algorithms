# Image-classification-by-color-using-Python-K-Nearest-Neighbors-and-Naive-Bayes-Algorithms

Machine learning project for image classification using Python and the K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes algorithms.

## The Objective of the project

- This program aims to classify test images in three categories by the most present color in the picture using the training data.







## Details

- A more detailed breakdown of the whole development process is included in the Documentation.pdf file, from the data acquiring process to the presentation of the code, conclusions and performance review.
- The dataset is uploaded as an archive due to it's size.
